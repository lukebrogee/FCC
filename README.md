This program is like the modern day autocorrect system on the standard phone text
messages. It is not as advanced but works in the same way. It will consist of a file
that will include an incorrect spelling in a sentence, the correct sentance, and the
words solutions that needs to be fixed. The program will match the incorrect words to 
the correct words and replace them. Finally will output the result.
